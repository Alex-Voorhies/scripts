AssemblyTools:
addFileName2header.pl	-	Add the name of the fasta/fastq file (without the extension) to the header. Useful when merging multiple fasta/fastq files and wish to easily keep track of sequences
batchBlast.pl	-	Run multiple Blasts at once in an "embarassingly" parallel manner
calcN50.pl	-	Calculate N50 and L50 values for a fasta file
chopper.pl	-	Chop a file (fasta/fastq/tab-delimited/multiple-line) into multiple parts.
createFastq.pl	-	Use the fasta and quality files to produce fastq files
CRISPR_spacer_extractor.pl	-	Given a fasta file with repeat sequences and a contig fasta file, get the positions of these repeats in the contigs and find the coordinates of spacers	
dereplicate.pl	-	Remove sequences that are exactly the same and maintain a record of the clusters.
extractSeqs.pl	-	Given a list of sequence names, extract the sequences from a fasta/fastq file
findStretchesOfNs.pl	-	Go through the fasta file and find the sequences with a 100 or more N's at a stretch.
gcSkew.pl	-	Calculate the GC skew for for a fasta file
getRandomData.pl	-	Extract a random % of data (fasta/fastq)
interleave.pl	-	Take the forward(1) and reverse(2) fasta/fastq files and arrange them such that all odd sequences are forward and evens are reverse.
kmerFreq.pl		-	Calculate any kmer frequency from the given fasta
length+GC.pl	-	Calculate the length and  GC content from the fasta file.
limit2Length.pl	-	Remove sequences from a fasta file that do not pass the length threshold set by the user. Print length distribution to the screen
usageStats.pl	-	Monitor a given process and email report when process finishes

BamTools:
bamTools.pl	-	Calculate average coverage for a given list of contig names. Samtools required.
