## Script Descriptions
* **createFastq.pl**	-	Use the fasta and quality files to produce fastq files
## Script Descriptions
* **CRISPR\_spacer\_extractor.pl**	-	Given a fasta file with repeat sequences and a contig fasta file, get the positions of these repeats in the contigs and find the coordinates of spacers
## Script Descriptions
* **dereplicate.pl**	-	Remove sequences that are exactly the same and maintain a record of the clusters.
## Script Descriptions

## Script Descriptions
* **kmerFreq.pl**		-	Calculate any kmer frequency from the given fasta
## Script Descriptions
* **length+GC.pl**	-	Calculate the length and  GC content from the fasta file.
